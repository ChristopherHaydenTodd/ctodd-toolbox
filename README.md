# Christopher H. Todd's Toolbox for interactions CLIs.

The ctodd-toolbox project will hold scripts and snippets for interacting with Shell, Bash, MacOS, and more. This will hold code for automating tasks that are common. Many of these scripts will be copied and modified into other projects (like the build scripts in docker and python) so that those projects have what they need to be run easily by the end user. Some of these scripts will be specific to usecases like setting up a new computer with all of the coding dependencies (like the Git scripts).
